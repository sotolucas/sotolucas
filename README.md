# 👨‍💻 Lucas Leonardo Soto - Cloud Architect 

[![committers.top badge](https://user-badge.committers.top/argentina_private/sotolucas.svg)](https://user-badge.committers.top/argentina_private/sotolucas)

## What I do

### 📏 Cloud architecture design
From scratch, or even if it's about migrating legacy systems to the cloud, I can design and implement secure, resilient and cost-efficient cloud solutions with a serverless focus.

### 📃 Coding
I address most of systems problems with coding solutions. Well documented and standarized scripting with Bash and Python, also IAC with Terraform and CloudFormation saved me tons of hours.

### 🖥 Servers management and configuration
With experience in traditional server management as Sysadmin and with tools as Ansible, Saltstack, and AWS Systems Manager I'm confident in managing large fleets of Debian-based, Red Hat, and Windows servers.

### ☁ Amazon Web Services expert
I've managed large scale production environments for multi-national companies like Banco Ripley and Cencosud, using most of the services offered by AWS. Also, I'm 5x AWS Certified.
