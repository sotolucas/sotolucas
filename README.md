# 👨‍💻 Lucas Leonardo Soto 
#### Solutions Architect

## About me
I’ve been working with Linux since 2012.
I’m responsible, pragmatic and dynamic.
I feel comfortable with team work and I give the
best to achieve all proposed goals.
I want to access to a job position in which I can
develop my skills, overcome myself personal
and proffesionally and have exciting challenges.
Critical thinking, decision-making and problem
solving are my top skills.


## What I do

### 📏 Cloud architecture design
From scratch, or even if it's about migrating legacy systems to the cloud, I can design and implement secure, resilient and cost-efficient cloud solutions with a serverless focus.

### 📃 Coding
I address most of systems problems with coding solutions. Well documented and standarized scripting with Bash and Python, also IAC with Terraform and CloudFormation saved me tons of hours.

### 🖥 Servers management and configuration
With experience in traditional server management as Sysadmin and with tools as Ansible, Saltstack, and AWS Systems Manager I'm confident in managing large fleets of Debian-based, Red Hat, and Windows servers.

### ☁ Amazon Web Services expert
I've managed large scale production environments for multi-national companies like Banco Ripley and Cencosud, using most of the services offered by AWS. Also, I'm 4x AWS Certified.
